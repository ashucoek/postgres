# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

pg_tde project follows rolling release strategy. So all security updates go to new versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any vulnerabilities to our project in [Jira](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/PG/issues).

If the vulnerability is accepted and confirmed by our experts, you should normally expect us to deliver
a version with a fix according to the timelines provided below:

For Percona created software (our engineers wrote the code):

- Low/Medium: 120 days
- High: 90 days
- Critical: ASAP but should not exceed 30 days

For Non-Percona created software (upstream provided/packaged) from the time the vendor releases a patch:

- Low/Medium: 2nd release from current version
- High: Next release
- Critical: Hotfix or no later than next release (our regular release cadence is once every month)
