# Versions and Supported PostgreSQL Deployments

The `pg_tde` extension is available for [Percona Server for PostgreSQL 17.x](https://docs.percona.com/postgresql/17/postgresql-server.html), an open source, drop-in replacement for PostgreSQL Community. This version provides the `tde_heap` access method and offers [full encryption capabilities](../features.md), including encryption of tables, indexes, WAL data, and support for logical replication.

The extension is tightly integrated with Percona Server for PostgreSQL to deliver enhanced encryption functionality that is not available in community builds.

By using our PostgreSQL distribution, you get:

- **Full encryption support** through the `tde_heap` access method, including tables, indexes, WAL data, and logical replication.
- **Enhanced performance and enterprise-ready features** not available in community builds.
- **Regular updates and security patches** backed by Perconaâ€™s expert support team.
- **Professional support** and guidance for secure PostgreSQL deployments.
