# Limitations of pg_tde

Limitations of `pg_tde` {{release}}:

* PostgreSQLâ€™s internal system tables, which include statistics and metadata, are not encrypted.
* Temporary files created when queries exceed `work_mem` are not encrypted. These files may persist during long-running queries or after a server crash which can expose sensitive data in plaintext on disk.

## Currently unsupported WAL tools

The following tools are currently unsupported with `pg_tde` WAL encryption:

* `pg_createsubscriber`
* `pg_verifybackup` (checksum mismatch with encrypted WAL)

The following tools and extensions in Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL have been tested and verified to work with `pg_tde` WAL encryption:

## Supported WAL tools

The following tools have been tested and verified by Percona to work with `pg_tde` WAL encryption:

* Patroni, for an example configuration see the following [Patroni configuration file](#example-patroni-configuration)
* `pg_basebackup` (with `--wal-method=stream` or `--wal-method=none`), for details on using `pg_basebackup` with WAL encryption, see [Backup with WAL encryption enabled](../how-to/backup-wal-enabled.md)
* `pg_resetwal`
* `pg_rewind`
* `pg_upgrade`
* `pg_waldump`
* pgBackRest

## Example Patroni configuration

The following is a Percona-tested example configuration.

!!! warning  
    The above example is Percona-tested, but Patroni versions differ, especially with discovery backends such as `etcd`. Ensure you adjust the configuration to match your environment, version, and security requirements.

## Next steps

Check which PostgreSQL versions and deployment types are compatible with `pg_tde` before planning your installation.
