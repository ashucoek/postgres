# TDE Benefits

## Benefits for organizations

* **Data safety:** Prevents unauthorized access to stored data, even if backup files or storage devices are stolen or leaked.
* **Enterprise-ready Architecture:** Supports both single and multi-tenancy, giving flexibility for SaaS providers or internal multi-user systems.

## Benefits for DBAs and engineers

* **Granular control:** Encrypt specific tables or databases instead of the entire system, reducing performance overhead.
* **Operational simplicity:** Works transparently without requiring major application changes.
* **Defense in depth:** Adds another layer of protection to existing controls like TLS (encryption in transit), access control, and role-based permissions.

When combined with the external Key Management Systems (KMS), TDE enables centralized control, auditing, and rotation of encryption keysâ€”critical for secure production environments.
